# Arduino-Keypad-Controller
This Arduino sketch interfaces with a custom keypad consisting of a 3x3 matrix     and 4 extra keys: '*', '0', '#', and 'R'. The extra keys are handled using     additional row pins. A status LED on pin 13 blinks whenever a key is detected. (keypad used in old telephone)
